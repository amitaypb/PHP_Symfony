REM If you're returning HTML from your controller, you'll probably want to render a template. 
REM Fortunately, Symfony comes with Twig: a templating language that's easy, powerful and actually quite fun.
REM use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
REM class LuckyController extends AbstractController
cd "C:\php"

REM Without Symfony Flex
composer require twig/twig
